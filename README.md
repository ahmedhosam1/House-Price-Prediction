🏠 House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts house prices using a Linear Regression model. The project focuses on feature selection, preprocessing, and reducing prediction error to improve model performance.

📌 Overview

Predict prices of houses using regression techniques with selected numerical features from the Kaggle Housing dataset.
Compared to the initial basic version, this improved version shows lower prediction error and better model accuracy.

📈 Model Improvement

The basic version used limited features and showed higher prediction error.

The improved version added more relevant numerical features and removed noisy columns → resulting in significant error reduction and predictions closer to actual prices.

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/ahmedhosam1/House-Price-Prediction.git


Open newmodelhouse.ipynb

Install required libraries:

pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib


Run all cells to train and evaluate the regression model.

📌 Future Enhancements

Try One-Hot Encoding instead of dropping categorical features

Compare with other models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)

Add actual error metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²) before vs after
